Article: Many of us have faced a rational and most often irrational phobia of maths and numbers as a child. But, if we think about quantifying mathematical data in systematically organized charts and graphs, the picture doesnâ€™t look scary.
React chart and data visualization libraries do something similar. In the preceding article, we will look at what are open-source React charting libraries in 2022 and some of the most reliable chart libraries available for React.
Additionally, all the frequently asked questions about the best React charting libraries are answered towards the end to give a comprehensive view of charting libraries for React.
Most web developers have a deep relationship with charts and graphs. When working on a project, they retrieve data from the database and present it meaningfully.
It can be challenging to create user-friendly charts. It is not a good idea to spend too much time creating visualizations.
By Using the right React chart library, you can quickly create stunning data visualizations. Your users will also be able to find more valuable insights faster.

What is a React Chart Library?
React Chart Libraries, also commonly known as React apps, work on visualizing the data, managing the libraries, allowing users to write and design the components, and assisting them in maintaining the data. These versatile and scalable apps use frameworks that are highly functional and sustainable in the long run.
React Chart Libraries prove to be a beneficial tool for web developers who wish to integrate meaningful data in their web projects. These apps basically help web developers display how a particular application or feature is working or expected to work in the near future. They can also be considered a boon to web developers since it has made them shift their focus to produce actual data without having to worry about its design and presentation.
The chart is a common component for mobile and web apps. Different types of charts provide different information. Digital charts are popular because they allow us to understand and gather crucial data in specific formats that suit our needs. Charts for React are also easier to work with and mainly include line charts, bar charts, pie charts, Gantt, and bubble charts.
React chart libraries are also known as React apps. These apps are flexible and scalable and use frameworks that can be used over time. Chart libraries for React are a helpful tool for web developers looking to incorporate meaningful data into their web projects.
Most popular React Chart Libraries for Your Web Projects
Many professionals are now switching their ways to use lightweight React chart libraries that are equipped with modular charting components for React to ease their work. Amidst this conventional change, we have brought a list of the best and most popular React chart component libraries to your screens. Without further ado, let us begin:
Recharts
Recharts is known to be one of the most reliable react chart libraries and, therefore, is also the most used by professionals and web developers. This react chart library light dependency on various D3 modules while also providing native SVG support throughout.The components used by recharts are completely presentational, partly because of their declarative nature.
It is widely known that most professionals recommend recharts as their first choice to those who are looking for an easy and simpler approach to get them through with the data visualization projects.
The platform has record-setting weekly npm downloads at 544,578. The app is popular among the developer community and facilitates the data visualization process of professionals with maximum convenience.
React-chartjs-2
If you are familiar with the chartjs charting library, you know that React-chartjs-2 is not a regular react chart library. Instead, it can be better understood as a react wrapper for chartjs, which is a charting library specific to JavaScript.For the unversed, chartjs is a beginner-friendly react chart library that uses the elements of HTML5 Canvas to build chart components that are unique in their types and kinds.
To use React-chartjs-2, one should be familiar with the documentation of Chartjs. Being an easy-to-understand framework, one should not face many difficulties in doing the same. With 338,760 weekly downloads, this react chart library is worth giving a chance to.
Victory
Used for React and React Native, Victory is another popular react chart library that has a set of charting components and uses the same API for all applications. The identical API allows the users to generate data in the form of charts for both Android and iOS applications. The library provides for easy cross-platform charting and is very simple to learn and use.Additionally, it also allows for convenient and straightforward integration of charts including line, pie, bar, and candlestick to the web and React Native applications. Developed by Formidable, Victory has a weekly npm download rate of 126,898.

Visx
Developed by Airbnb, Visx is a new name in the field of React Chart Libraries that has acquired approximately 14.2k stars on GitHub, which is a grand achievement. The most considerable flex of using Visx as an active repository is that it combines the merits of React DOM with D3.js in a systematic way.A piece of exciting news is that the developers of Visx do not claim it to be a react chart library as such. Instead, they view it as a collection of low-level visualization components that can be easily reused.
One can also have a look at the Bar Chart Example Code of this easy-to-use platform to gain a better and enhanced understanding of how it actually works.
Nivo
Nivo gives a novel way for web developers to generate charts and other data on the side of the server. There are varied and creative templates available for data visualization and presentation purposes that one can choose from. The chart library offers distinctive and eye-catching options for presenting meaningful data.Nivo dispenses SVG, HTML, and Canvas charts in a single charting library while also offering transitions (or motions). If you are looking for a precise and versatile solution to your data visualization needs, Nivo acts as a one-stop-shop for you.
It promises to give you an engaging user experience with gradients in charts.
React vis
Developed by the web developers of Uber Open Source, React vis is a pioneering name in the field of React Chart Libraries. It delivers a pretty easy and fast approach to understand the charting of components for your data visualization needs.Some of the most common data visualization charts available include line chart, area chart, bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, contour plots, heat maps, hexagon heatmaps, scatterplots, pie and donut charts, sunbursts, radar charts, parallel coordinates, and treemap to name a few.
Users appreciate the documentation for its ability to design and choose from a number of charts. This is evident from the 8k stars it has received on GitHub in a short span.
